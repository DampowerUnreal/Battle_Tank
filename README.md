# Battle_Tank Game

This is my first game, following Ben Tristem Course.

## Concept
*Tank battle is an open-world head-to-head tank combat game.
*The terrain will be used for tactical advantage
*The focus will be on flow and fell

## Rules
*You can move anywhere in the terrain, which is surrounded by mountains
*Both players start with finite health and ammo
*Each direct hit takes away health
*The last player standing wins

## Requirements
*SFX : 	Gun firing, explosion, barrel moving, turret moving, engine sound.
*Static Mesh : 	Simple tank comprising tracks, body, turret and barrel.
*Textures :	Later-on weÂ´ll want to add for visual flares.
*Music : 	Background music to create tension.
